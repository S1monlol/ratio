# Introduction

There are so many arguments that are stalled with the "oh but God says this is the way" that it is often enough that it inspired this entire website.

<br></br>

# Homosexuality

One of the most common stances that I deal with that Christianity makes complicated is "is being gay against the bible"?  
Shorts answer: If you believe that being gay is against the bible, you also belive slavery is okay.

Long answer :

## Slavery

There's an entire [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_slavery?lang=en) about this, but here are a couple interesting snipits

<b>Leviticus 25:44-46</b>
<pre>
  [As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may buy male and
  female slaves from among the nations that are around you. 45 You may also buy
  from among the strangers who sojourn with you and their clans that are with
  you, who have been born in your land, and they may be your property. 46 You
  may bequeath them to your sons after you to inherit as a possession forever.
  You may make slaves of them, but over your brothers the people of Israel you
  shall not rule, one over another
  ruthlessly.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+25%3A44-46&version=ESV)
</pre>
<b>Exodus 21:1-36</b>
<pre>
  [Now these are the rules that you shall set before them. When you buy a Hebrew
  slave, he shall serve six years, and in the seventh he shall go out free, for
  nothing. If he comes in single, he shall go out single; if he comes in
  married, then his wife shall go out with him. If his master gives him a wife
  and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be her
  master's, and he shall go out alone. But if the slave plainly says, â€˜I love my
  master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out
  free](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21%3A1-36&version=ESV)
</pre>

<b>Colossians 4:1</b>
<pre>
  [Masters, treat your bondservants justly and fairly, knowing that you also
  have a Master in
  heaven](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+4%3A1&version=ESV)
</pre>


"But actually that was interpreted differently than at the time" keep reading to the next section goon

### Interpretation is so weird

The Bible's stance on "man not lying with man" in Leviticus relates to concerns of health, lineage, and maintaining Israel's identity. The New Testament references, like in 1 Corinthians and 1 Timothy, likely criticize the exploitation of younger men by older ones, known as pederasty. Paul's letter to the Romans discusses the dangers of idolatry and self-centered lust, emphasizing the need for love and service in Christian relationships as depicted elsewhere in the Bible (Markham , 2018).  
One might ask, why am I not interpreting the slavery part of the bible litterly, and the "gay" part in a non-litteral way? Well, if you look back to the [section about the old testament](#the-old-testament), you'll see that it's a little harder to justify "`you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are around you`".  
The verses from Leviticus cited above explicitly address the ownership and treatment of slaves. Slavery was an integral part of many ancient societies, including those of the Israelites. When the Bible was written, slavery was a well-established institution.

<u>
  It's inconsistent to accept one part of the Bible as a literal command for all
  times and cultures while interpreting another part as culturally or
  historically bounded. If one uses Leviticus to condemn same-sex relationships
  but doesn't advocate for slavery, they're employing an inconsistent arguments.

### Love Thy Neighbor?
